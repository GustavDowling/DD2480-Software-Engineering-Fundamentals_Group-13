# DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals (Group 13)

### Launch Interceptor Program
A hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system that decides if the launch button should be unlocked based on radar tracking information.

### Motivation
The motivation for this project was to learn about Software Fundamentals when developing software in teams. How to divide work, write proper commit messages and write tests were some of the goals.

### Tests
The file DecideTest contains all the unit tests for each function. Running it will perform all the tests and only output error messages in case of a failed test.
```
javac -Xlint:unchecked DecideTest.java
java -ea DecideTest
```

### Contributions

Amar - Wrote and tested the functions for LIC0, LIC1, LIC8, LIC9, LIC10, CMV and Decide. Also wrote the first README draft and made various refactoring of the code base.

Gustav - Code skeleton for Decide.java and DecideTest.java, smallest radius of three points method, LIC12, LIC13, LIC14, LIC7, refactoring LIC2, PUM method, FUV method

Petter - Wrote and tested the functions LIC2, LIC3, LIC4, LIC6, LIC11, and wrote formal tests for LIC3, LIC4, LIC6 and LIC11.
